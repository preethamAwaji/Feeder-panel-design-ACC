# Outdoor Feeder Panel : Robust and Reliable


During my internship at Abhi Controls & Coatings i got a chance to work on Industry level project (Outdoor Feeder Panel). This distribution panel is designed to handle a 125A incoming load and distribute it efficiently to 12 outgoing circuits, each rated at 32A. It is engineered to meet the IPX4 series protection standards, ensuring durability and safety in various environments.

## Tech Stack

**Pannel Power flow:** BYPass Circuit / Parallel flow

**Installation:** Outdoor Installation


## Features

- Incoming Load Capacity: 125A

- Outgoing Circuits: 12 circuits, each rated at 32A

- Protection Standard: IPX4 series, providing protection against water splashes

- Busbar Design: Optimized for efficient current distribution and minimal voltage drop



# Switchgears:
- INCOMMER: 125A MCCB (Moulded case circuit breaker) is used as main breaker according to the load calculation & design constrains
- OUTGOING: 32A KIT KAT Fuse (Re-wireable fuse ) is used for outgoing circuits as protective device

# Enclosure 
- Enclosure houses all the components of the panel made of **16mm MS SHEET** & **Powder coated with SIMENS GRAY**

# Busbar Design and Current Capacity
## Main Incomer Busbar
The main incomer busbar is constructed using a 25mm x 10mm aluminum bar, capable of handling the full 125A incoming load. This configuration ensures:

- High Current-Carrying Capacity
- Minimal Heat Buildup
- Robust Performance

## Outgoing Busbar
The outgoing busbars distribute power to the 12 individual 32A circuits and are made from 20mm x 10mm aluminum bars, providing:

- Safe Current Density
- Efficient Distribution
- Durability:
